# AngelHack AWS Hackathon

## Powered by:
### AWS Amplify, Pinpoint (Analytics), S3

## WeSearch
### We aim to digitalize Contract Research by offering a multi-sided platform in China. Through our mobile app, research organizations can publish their (paid) research studies like food-tasting, voice-recording etc. On the other hand, with our matching algorithm, users can easily hand-pick the research studies that they are interested in. 

## Web Analytics
### Over time, we provide valuable analytics, giving a better curation and a personal touch to the users and further insights to research organizations. 

### Quick Start
* Install dependencies by running `yarn` or `npm install`.
* Run `yarn start` or `npm run start` to start the local development server.

### Resources:

### Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
